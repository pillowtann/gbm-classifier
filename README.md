# gbm-classifier
Personalised function wrapping around standard ML packages for Classification Task<br>
<br>
The Jupyter Notebook attached is a group of definitions utilising common ML packages for the purpose of classifying a binary variable (1,0). 
In my use case, I am predicting if an article is sold or not (Variable: Is_Sold 1,0) <br>

The code performs Data Split (by Time), KFolds, Data Processing within Folds, Training and returns Average predictions.<br>
The personalisation comes in for optionality for asymmetrical objective, future prediction dataset within code, KFold by and nsplits, etc.
